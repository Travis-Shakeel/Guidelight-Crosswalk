# Project: LED Pedestrian Crosswalk Prototype


Developed a prototype LED light system designed to improve pedestrian safety at crosswalks during low-visibility conditions such as nighttime and adverse weather. The system uses an Arduino microcontroller to control a sequence of LEDs embedded along a crosswalk, simulating directional lighting to alert drivers and guide pedestrians safely across.

Designed and implemented sequential LED control logic that illuminates LEDs in both forward and backward patterns, enhancing visibility and driver awareness.

Programmed using Arduino IDE with digitalWrite() and timing functions to create smooth and clear LED transitions.

Selected red LEDs to reduce glare and improve visibility under different environmental conditions.

Structured the code modularly to easily scale the number of LEDs and adjust timing parameters.

Encased the hardware prototype in a protective housing for demonstration and testing purposes.
